                <h2>St Josephs School</h2>
                <p>St. Josephs School was established in 1955 by its founder Principal Late Miss Bertha Pereira as a Primary School, catering to the need for a personal touch in primary education where it is imperative to know the child before you attempt to educate him.  With the passage of time, it soon became evident that primary education fulfilled this need only upto a point. In order to maintain the rapport established between teacher & pupil in the primary school, it became necessary to venture into secondary education. In June 1982 the secondary section first saw the light of day with a fledging staff and 45 students. Over the years the school has grown from strength to strength and has acquired an enviable reputation in the field of education. It is administered by St. Dominic Education Trust.</p>
                <p>My favourite class here was the PE lecture because we got to go to the school ground and play cricket and football that too it was for 2 hours at end of the day so basically the last 2 lectures of the day.</p>
